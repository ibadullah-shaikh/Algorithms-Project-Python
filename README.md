# Algorithms-Project-Python

We have introduced a system that can accommodate between 10 to 100 nodes for all said
graph algorithms as follows:
(1) Prims
(2) Kruskal
(3) Dijkstra
(4) Bellman Ford
(5) Floyd Warshall Algorithm
(6) Clustering Coefficient in Graph Theory (Only Local Clustering). The final cost should be the
average of all local clustering of all nodes
(7)Bor≈Øvka's algorithm
For an inputted adjacency matrix, a corresponding graph is returned. 

# Note:
To run this project download the ALGO_PROJECT.py file and benchmark folder, open the .py file in VS code and change the path in code for the benchmark folder, there are two places where you have to change the path for benchmark folder, after changing simply run it... and here you go !!!
