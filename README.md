# Algorithms-Project-Python

We have introduced a system that can accommodate between 10 to 100 nodes for all said
graph algorithms as follows:
(1) Prims
(2) Kruskal
(3) Dijkstra
(4) Bellman Ford
(5) Floyd Warshall Algorithm
(6) Clustering Coefficient in Graph Theory (Only Local Clustering). The final cost should be the
average of all local clustering of all nodes
(7)Bor≈Øvka's algorithm
For an inputted adjacency matrix, a corresponding graph is returned.
